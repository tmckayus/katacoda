We need to generate some test data for Prometheus which can take a couple of minutes.

Once the environment is set up,

The Prometheus console can be accessed using the following url:

http://prometheus-demo-route-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

![Prometheus Console](./prometheus-api-client/assets/02-prometheus-console.png)

The jupyter environment with the workshop notebooks is available here:

http://custom-notebook-myproject.[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

You will need a password to access the environment.
The password is `secret`{{copy}}

The notebook we will be using is called: `Introduction_Prometheus_API_Client.ipynb`
