# Introduction

In this workshop we will learn about using the Prometheus API Client for Python to collect and
manipulate Prometheus metric Time-Series data.

We will use a jupyter notebook to interact with a Prometheus instance which is currently being deployed.

Please give the environment a couple of minutes to set up.
